Protect yourself from the sun</strong></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most important ways to take care of your skin is to protect it from the sun. A lifetime of sun exposure can cause wrinkles, age spots and other skin problems &mdash; as well as increase the risk of skin cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For the most complete sun protection:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Use sunscreen.</strong>&nbsp;Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 15. Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours &mdash; or more often if you&#39;re swimming or perspiring.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Seek shade.</strong>&nbsp;Avoid the sun between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., when the sun&#39;s rays are strongest.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Wear protective clothing.</strong>&nbsp;Cover your skin with tightly woven long-sleeved shirts, long pants and wide-brimmed hats. Also consider laundry additives, which give clothing an additional layer of ultraviolet protection for a certain number of washings, or special sun-protective clothing &mdash; which is specifically designed to block ultraviolet rays.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3><strong>2.

Hair follicles are the structures in skin that form hair. While hair can be lost from any part of the body, alopecia areata usually affects the head and face. Hair typically falls out in small, round patches about the size of a quarter, but in some cases, hair loss is more extensive. Most people with the disease are healthy and have no other symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The course of alopecia areata varies from person to person. Some have bouts of hair loss throughout their lives, while others only have one episode. Recovery is unpredictable too, with hair regrowing fully in some people but not others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is no cure for alopecia areata, but there are treatments that help hair grow back more quickly. There are also resources to help people cope with hair loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who Gets Alopecia Areata?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyone can have alopecia areata. Men and women get it equally, and it affects all racial and ethnic groups. The onset can be at any age, but most people get it in their teens, twenties, or thirties. When it occurs in children younger than age 10, it tends to be more extensive and progressive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you have a close family member with the disease, you may have a higher risk of getting it, but for many people, there is no family history. Scientists have linked a number of genes to the disease, which suggests that genetics play a role in alopecia areata. Many of the genes they have found are important for the functioning of the immune system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>People with certain autoimmune diseases, such as psoriasis, thyroid disease, or vitiligo, are more likely to get alopecia areata, as are those with allergic conditions such as hay fever.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is possible that emotional stress or an illness can bring on alopecia areata in people who are at risk, but in most cases, there is no obvious trigger.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Types of Alopecia Areata</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three main types of alopecia areata:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Patchy alopecia areata.</strong>&nbsp;In this type, which is the most common, hair loss happens in one or more coin-sized patches on the scalp or other parts of the body.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Alopecia totalis.</strong>&nbsp;People with this type lose all or nearly all of the hair on their scalp.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Alopecia universalis.</strong>&nbsp;In this type, which is rare, there is a complete or nearly complete loss of hair on the scalp, face, and rest of the body.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Symptoms of Alopecia Areata</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Alopecia areata primarily affects hair, but in some cases, there are nail changes as well. People with the disease are usually healthy and have no other symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Hair Changes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alopecia areata typically begins with sudden loss of round or oval patches of hair on the scalp, but any part of the body may be affected, such as the beard area in men, or the eyebrows or eyelashes. Around the edges of the patch, there are often short broken hairs or &ldquo;exclamation point&rdquo; hairs that are narrower at their base than their tip. There is usually no sign of a rash, redness, or scarring on the bare patches. Some people say they feel tingling, burning, or itching on patches of skin right before the hair falls out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When a bare patch develops, it is hard to predict what will happen next. The possibilities include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>The hair regrows within a few months. It may look white or gray at first but may regain its natural color over time.</li>\r\n	<li>Additional bare patches develop. Sometimes hair regrows in the first patch while new bare patches are forming.</li>\r\n	<li>Small patches join to form larger ones. In rare cases, hair is eventually lost from the entire scalp, called alopecia totalis.</li>\r\n	<li>There is a progression to complete loss of body hair, a type of the disease called alopecia universalis. This is rare.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>In most cases, the hair regrows, but there may be subsequent episodes of hair loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hair tends to regrow on its own more fully in people with:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Less extensive hair loss.</li>\r\n	<li>Later age of onset.</li>\r\n	<li>No nail changes.</li>\r\n	<li>No family history of the disease.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Nail Changes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nail changes such as ridges and pits occur in some people, especially those who have more extensive hair loss.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Causes of Alopecia Areata</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In alopecia areata, the immune system mistakenly attacks hair follicles, causing inflammation. Researchers do not fully understand what causes the immune attack on hair follicles, but they believe that both genetic and environmental (non-genetic) factors play a role.</p>\r\n', 'Dr. Helper ', 'SKIN SURGERY & COSMOTOLOGY', 'Skin Problem', 1),
(13, 'Acne', 'Acneacne.jpg', '<h2>Overview of Acne</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Acne is a common skin condition that happens when hair follicles under the skin become clogged. Sebum&mdash;oil that helps keep skin from drying out&mdash;and dead skin cells plug the pores, which leads to outbreaks of lesions, commonly called pimples or zits. Most often, the outbreaks occur on the face but can also appear on the back, chest, and shoulders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Acne is an inflammatory disorder of the skin, which has sebaceous (oil) glands that connects to the hair follicle, which contains a fine hair. In healthy skin, the sebaceous glands make sebum that empties onto the skin surface through the pore, which is an opening in the follicle. Keratinocytes, a type of skin cell, line the follicle. &nbsp;Normally as the body sheds skin cells, the keratinocytes rise to the surface of the skin. When someone has acne, the hair, sebum, and keratinocytes stick together inside the pore. This prevents the keratinocytes from shedding and keeps the sebum from reaching the surface of the skin. The mixture of oil and cells allows bacteria that normally live on the skin to grow in the plugged follicles and cause inflammation&mdash;swelling, redness, heat, and pain. When the wall of the plugged follicle breaks down, it spills the bacteria, skin cells, and sebum into nearby skin, creating lesions or pimples.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For most people, acne tends to go away by the time they reach their thirties, but some people in their forties and fifties continue to have this skin problem.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Who Gets Acne?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>People of all races and ages get acne, but it is most common in teens and young adults. When acne appears during the teenage years, it is more common in males. Acne can continue into adulthood, and when it does, it is more common in women.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Types of Acne</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Acne causes several types of lesions, or pimples. Doctors refer to enlarged or plugged hair follicles as comedones. Types of acne include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Whiteheads: Plugged hair follicles that stay beneath the skin and produce a white bump.</li>\r\n	<li>Blackheads: Plugged follicles that reach the surface of the skin and open up. They look black on the skin surface because the air discolors the sebum, not because they are dirty.</li>\r\n	<li>Papules: Inflamed lesions that usually appear as small, pink bumps on the skin and can be tender to the touch.</li>\r\n	<li>Pustules or pimples: Papules topped by white or yellow pus-filled lesions that may be red at the base.</li>\r\n	<li>Nodules: Large, painful solid lesions that are lodged deep within the skin.</li>\r\n	<li>Severe nodular acne (sometimes called cystic acne): Deep, painful, pus-filled lesions.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>test</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Causes of Acne</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Doctors and researchers believe that one or more of the following can lead to the development of acne:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Excess or high production of oil in the pore.</li>\r\n	<li>Buildup of dead skin cells in the pore.</li>\r\n	<li>Growth of bacteria in the pore.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The following factors may increase your risk for developing acne:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Hormones.</strong>&nbsp;An increase in androgens, which are male sex hormones, may lead to acne. These increase in both boys and girls normally during puberty and cause the sebaceous glands to enlarge and make more sebum. Hormonal changes related to pregnancy can also cause acne.&nbsp;</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Family history.</strong>&nbsp;Researchers believe that you may be more likely to get acne if your parents had acne.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Medications.&nbsp;</strong>Certain medications, such as medications that contain hormones, corticosteroids, and lithium, can cause acne.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Age.</strong>&nbsp;People of all ages can get acne, but it is more common in teens.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;The following do not cause acne, but may make it worse.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Diet. Some studies show that eating certain foods may make acne worse. Researchers are continuing to study the role of diet as a cause of acne.</li>\r\n	<li>Stress.</li>\r\n	<li>Pressure from sports helmets, tight clothes, or backpacks.</li>\r\n	<li>Environmental irritants, such as pollution and high humidity.</li>\r\n	<li>Squeezing or picking at blemishes.</li>\r\n	<li>Scrubbing your skin too hard.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n', 'Dr. Helper ', 'SKIN SURGERY & COSMOTOLOGY', 'Skin Problem', 1),

For some people, it flares and then clears up for a time, even for several years.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>When to see a doctor</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Talk with a health care provider if you or your child:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Has symptoms of atopic dermatitis</li>\r\n	<li>Is so uncomfortable that the condition is affecting sleep and daily activities</li>\r\n	<li>Has a skin infection &mdash; look for new streaks, pus, yellow scabs</li>\r\n	<li>Has symptoms even after trying self-care steps</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Seek immediate medical attention</strong>&nbsp;if you or your child has a fever and the rash looks infected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In some people, atopic dermatitis is related to a gene variation that affects the skin&#39;s ability to provide protection. With a weak barrier function, the skin is less able to retain moisture and protect against bacteria, irritants, allergens and environmental factors &mdash; such as tobacco smoke.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In other people, atopic dermatitis is caused by too much of the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus on the skin. This displaces helpful bacteria and disrupts the skin&#39;s barrier function.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A weak skin barrier function might also trigger an immune system response that causes the inflamed skin and other symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atopic dermatitis (eczema) is one of several types of dermatitis. Other common types are contact dermatitis and seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff). Dermatitis isn&#39;t contagious.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Risk factors</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>The main risk factor for atopic dermatitis is having had eczema, allergies, hay fever or asthma in the past. Having family members with these conditions also increases your risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Complications</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Complications of atopic dermatitis (eczema) may include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Asthma and hay fever.</strong>&nbsp;Many people with atopic dermatitis develop asthma and hay fever. This can happen before or after developing atopic dermatitis.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Food allergies.</strong>&nbsp;People with atopic dermatitis often develop food allergies. One of the main symptoms of this condition is hives (urticaria).</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Chronic itchy, scaly skin.</strong>&nbsp;A skin condition called neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus) starts with a patch of itchy skin. You scratch the area, which provides only temporary relief. Scratching actually makes the skin itchier because it activates the nerve fibers in your skin. Over time, you may scratch out of habit. This condition can cause the affected skin to become discolored, thick and leathery.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Patches of skin that&#39;s darker or lighter than the surrounding area.</strong>&nbsp;This complication after the rash has healed is called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. It&#39;s more common in people with brown or Black skin. It might take several months for the discoloration to fade.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Skin infections.</strong>&nbsp;Repeated scratching that breaks the skin can cause open sores and cracks. These increase the risk of infection from bacteria and viruses. These skin infections can spread and become life-threatening.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Irritant hand dermatitis.</strong>&nbsp;This especially affects people whose hands are often wet and exposed to harsh soaps, detergents and disinfectant at work.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Allergic contact dermatitis.</strong>&nbsp;This condition is common in people with atopic dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis is an itchy rash caused by touching substances you&#39;re allergic to. The color of the rash varies depending on your skin color.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Sleep problems.</strong>&nbsp;The itchiness of atopic dermatitis can interfere with sleep.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Mental health conditions.</strong>&nbsp;Atopic dermatitis is associated with depression and anxiety. This may be related to the constant itching and sleep problems common among people with atopic dermatitis.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Prevention</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Developing a basic skin care routine may help prevent eczema flares. The following tips may help reduce the drying effects of bathing:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p><strong>Moisturize your skin at least twice a day.</strong>&nbsp;Creams, ointments, shea butter and lotions seal in moisture. Choose a product or products that work well for you. Ideally, the best one for you will be safe, effective, affordable and unscented.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Using petroleum jelly on your baby&#39;s skin may help prevent development of atopic dermatitis.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Take a daily bath or shower.</strong>&nbsp;Use warm, rather than hot, water and limit your bath or shower to about 10 minutes.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Use a gentle, nonsoap cleanser.</strong>&nbsp;Choose a cleanser that&#39;s free of dyes, alcohols and fragrance. For young children, you usually need only warm water to get them clean &mdash; no soap or bubble bath needed. Soap can be especially irritating to the skin of young children. For people of any age, deodorant soaps and antibacterial soaps can remove too much of the skin&#39;s natural oils and dry the skin. Don&#39;t scrub the skin with a washcloth or loofah.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Pat dry.</strong>&nbsp;After bathing, gently pat the skin with a soft towel. Apply moisturizer while your skin is still damp (within three minutes).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>The triggers for atopic dermatitis vary widely from person to person. Try to identify and avoid irritants that trigger your eczema. In general, avoid anything that causes an itch because scratching often triggers a flare.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Common triggers for atopic dermatitis include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Rough wool fabric</li>\r\n	<li>Dry skin</li>\r\n	<li>Skin infection</li>\r\n	<li>Heat and sweat</li>\r\n	<li>Stress</li>\r\n	<li>Cleaning products</li>\r\n	<li>Dust mites and pet dander</li>\r\n	<li>Mold</li>\r\n	<li>Pollen</li>\r\n	<li>Smoke from tobacco</li>\r\n	<li>Cold and dry air</li>\r\n	<li>Fragrances</li>\r\n	<li>Other irritating chemicals</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Infants and children may have flares triggered by eating certain foods, such as eggs and cow&#39;s milk. Talk with your child&#39;s health care provider about identifying potential food allergies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once you understand what triggers your eczema, talk with your health care provider about how to manage your symptoms and prevent flares.</p>\r\n', 'Dr. Helper ', 'SKIN SURGERY & COSMOTOLOGY', 'Skin Problem', 1),
(15, 'Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS)', 'Hidradenitis Suppurativa (HS)cs-hidradenitis-suppurativa-and-skin-cancer-1440x810.jpg', '<h2>Overview</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Hidradenitis suppurativa</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hidradenitis suppurativa (hi-drad-uh-NIE-tis sup-yoo-ruh-TIE-vuh) is a condition that causes small, painful lumps to form under the skin. The lumps usually develop in areas where your skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts. The lumps heal slowly, recur, and can lead to tunnels under the skin and scarring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hidradenitis suppurativa tends to start after puberty. It can persist for many years and worsen over time, with serious effects on your daily life and emotional well-being. Combined medical and surgical therapy can help manage the disease and prevent complications.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Symptoms</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Hidradenitis suppurativa can affect one or several areas of the body. Signs and symptoms of the condition include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Blackheads.</strong>&nbsp;Blackheads appear in small pitted areas of skin, often appearing in pairs.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Painful pea-sized lumps.</strong>&nbsp;The condition usually starts with a single, painful lump under the skin that persists for weeks or months. More bumps may form later, usually in areas where you have more sweat and oil glands or where the skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Leaking bumps or sores.</strong>&nbsp;Some bumps or sores get bigger, break open and drain pus with an odor.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Tunnels.</strong>&nbsp;Over time, tunnels might form under the skin, connecting the lumps. These wounds heal very slowly, if at all, and drain blood and pus.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Some people with this condition experience only mild symptoms. The course of the disease is highly variable. Excess weight and being a smoker are associated with worse symptoms, but even people who are thin and don&#39;t smoke can experience severe disease.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>When to see a doctor</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Early diagnosis of hidradenitis suppurativa is key to getting effective treatment. See your doctor if your condition:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Is painful</li>\r\n	<li>Makes it difficult to move</li>\r\n	<li>Doesn&#39;t improve in a few weeks</li>\r\n	<li>Returns within weeks of treatment</li>\r\n	<li>Appears in several locations</li>\r\n	<li>Flares often</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Hidradenitis suppurativa is not just a boil, and many people with this condition also have related conditions. People with hidradenitis suppurativa benefit from a health care team with medical and surgical dermatologists at the core. Other specialists are involved as needed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Causes</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Hidradenitis suppurativa develops when hair follicles become blocked. The exact cause for this isn&#39;t known. Experts think it could be connected to hormones, genetic predisposition, cigarette smoking or excess weight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hidradenitis suppurativa is not caused by an infection or being unclean, and it can&#39;t be spread to other people.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Risk factors</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Factors that increase your chance of developing hidradenitis suppurativa include:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Age.</strong>&nbsp;The risk of hidradenitis suppurativa is higher for people in their 20s and 30s.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Sex.</strong>&nbsp;Females are more likely to develop hidradenitis suppurativa than are males.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Race.</strong>&nbsp;Ethnicity or race might affect risk level. In the United States, the condition&#39;s prevalence is disproportionately high among Black people.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Family history.</strong>&nbsp;A tendency to develop hidradenitis suppurativa can be inherited.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Certain conditions.</strong>&nbsp;Hidradenitis suppurativa is more common and severe in people who are overweight. It also has an association with severe acne, arthritis, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Smoking.</strong>&nbsp;Smoking tobacco has been linked to hidradenitis suppurativa.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Complications</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Persistent and severe hidradenitis suppurativa can cause complications, including:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Infection.</strong>&nbsp;The affected area is susceptible to secondary infection, but the presence of pus is common in hidradenitis suppurativa and doesn&#39;t necessarily mean infection.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Scars and skin changes.</strong>&nbsp;The wounds may heal but leave ropelike scars or pitted skin.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Restricted movement.</strong>&nbsp;Sores and scar tissue can cause limited or painful movement, especially when the disease affects the armpits or thighs.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Skin cancer.</strong>&nbsp;Squamous cell carcinoma has been reported with long-term hidradenitis suppurativa, particularly in people whose condition involves the perianal area.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Swelling in the arms, legs or genitals.</strong>&nbsp;The most common sites for hidradenitis suppurativa also contain many lymph nodes. Scar tissue can interfere with the lymph drainage system, which can result in swelling in the arms, legs or genitals.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Psychological effects and social isolation.</strong>&nbsp;The location, drainage and odor of the sores can cause embarrassment and reluctance to go out in public, leading to anxiety or depression.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n', 'Dr. Helper ', 'SKIN SURGERY & COSMOTOLOGY', 'Skin Problem', 1);
